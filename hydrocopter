    "description": "An aerial ride on a gyrocopter in Dubai will allow you to enjoy beautiful panoramas of the city from a height of 450 meters! Gyrocopters (also known as gyroplanes or gyroplanes) are small, two-seat aircraft with a rotating propeller. Outwardly, they resemble open helicopters. Gyrocopters are great for sightseeing tours due to their safety, stability, efficiency and ease of operation. With a professional pilot at the controls, you can relax and enjoy your 20-minute flight.
